Hello, I'm Olive McCullough.
Having worked 3 years as a web application tester, I'm now taking my career in the direction of web development.
Having originally studied development at university, I'm now taking some time to reskill and perfect my knowledge base, learning Python, Django, React, and other technologies I find it much more fulfilling work.

Please check some of my current projects:
- Pixax, a Django-based tool that allows users to upload, sort, rate, and share photos: https://github.com/OliveMcCullough/Pixax-Project
- Minesweeper3D, a React project for a Minesweeper 3D game where numbers also indicate mines on a third direction represented by separate layers: https://github.com/OliveMcCullough/Minesweeper3D
