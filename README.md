Hello, I'm Olive McCullough.
Having worked 3 years as a web application tester, I'm now taking my career in the direction of web development.
Having originally studied development at university, I'm now taking some time to reskill and perfect my knowledge base, learning Python, Django, React, and other technologies as I find it much more fulfilling work.

Please check some of my recent projects:
- Pixax, a Django-based tool that allows users to upload, sort, rate, and share photos: https://github.com/OliveMcCullough/Pixax-Project
- Minesweeper3D, a React project for a Minesweeper 3D game where numbers also indicate mines on a third direction represented by separate layers: https://github.com/OliveMcCullough/Minesweeper3D
- BirdWatch, a React project that uses API calls from a variety of APIs to let users discover what kind of birds can be found nearby: https://github.com/OliveMcCullough/BirdWatch
- Oobase, a NextJS website and API project that provides information useful for playing the game Ooblets by Glumberland: https://github.com/OliveMcCullough/oobase

Please bear in mind some of these applications are unfinished and therefore currently have their limitations.
