Hello, I'm Olive McCullough.
Having worked 3 years as a web application tester, I'm now taking my career in the direction of web development.
Having originally studied development at university, I'm now taking some time to reskill and perfect my knowledge base, learning Python, Django, and other technologies I find it much more fulfilling work.

Please check out my current project, a tool that allows users to upload, sort, rate, and share photos.
